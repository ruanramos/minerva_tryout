A small script I made to help on the selection process of UFRJ's League of Legends college team. After giving notes to players on each individual sheet, we can get the results ordered on a new sheet. Made it in a hurry but it's quite scalable.

Also there is a function to search for a sheet tab by a name typed into an input field.
